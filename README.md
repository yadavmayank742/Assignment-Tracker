# Assignment-Tracker
This is an Assignment deadline tracker and also to keep track of the marks obtained in the completed assignments. 

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/yadavmayank742/Assignment-Tracker.git`

`cd Assignment-Tracker`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


# Execution 
`python tracker.py`


# Notes
1. This is a WIP (work in progess)
2. This app creates and uses a JSON file (`assignments.json`) to store the information, so, in case you're planning to move the `tracker.py` to some other directory, make sure to move `assignments.json` to the same directory else you'll lose the information.
